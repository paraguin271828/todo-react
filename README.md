# Simple Todo list in React

This is a simple implementation of a todo list to try out some features in React.

Three items are created by default.

The user can *mark* an element as done, *add* new list items, 
*edit* title and description and *delete* entries.

All items are **temporary** for now and won't be saved.
A simple Express backend with a REST API and a database connection could be implemented later.

For icons the ForkAwesome project is used.
